Write a function called sum_floats. This function should accept a list of nums. 
The function should return the sum of all nums that are floats. 
If there are no floats, the function should return 0.

Hints: to find out if a number if a float, use "isinstance(num, float)"

Examples

```py
sum_floats(1.5, 2.4, 'awesome', [], 1) # 3.9
sum_floats(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # 0
```
