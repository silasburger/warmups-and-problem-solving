Create a class, `RunningAverage`. It should provide one method,
`avg`, which takes a single numbers. Each time you call that
method, it should return the running average of all numbers
given so far.  

Examples

```py
r = RunningAverage()
r.avg(10)  # 10
r.avg(11)  # 10.5
r.avg(12)  # 11

r2 = RunningAverage()
r2.avg2(1)  # 1
r2.avg2(3)  # 2
```
